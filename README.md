# GrowingMicrocolonyProtection
This project gives a framework for simulating a growing bacteria microcolony being attacked by a phage invasion.
The code has been used in the publication "A growing microcolony can survive and support persistent propagation of virulent phages" by Rasmus Skytte Eriksen, Sine L. Svenningsen, Kim Sneppen and Namiko Mitarai published in PNAS January 9th 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708954115).
